# nodewikiaapi
JavaScript wrapper for the (no longer supported) Fandom's **Wikia API V1**.

## ⚠️ UNSTABLE ⚠️
The Wikia API V1 [lost its documentation](https://community.fandom.com/f/p/4400000000001906655) following the [UCP update](https://community.fandom.com/wiki/Help:Unified_Community_Platform). Some of the endpoints disappeared without notice throughout the years and, generally, it seems that this API is no longer supported. Thus any of the wrapper library's methods could stop working at any time. It is not recommended to use this library for fresh projects any longer, however, I am keeping it online to make sure that all of the current users can keep depending on it.

## Documentation
The documentation is available on [Github Pages](https://tchojnacki.github.io/nodewikiaapi/).
